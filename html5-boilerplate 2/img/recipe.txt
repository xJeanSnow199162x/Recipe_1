Stove-Top Smoked and Roasted Pork Loin



Ingredients


Main Dish

4 to 5 pounds Pork loin, boneless

1 cup Wood chips


Seasoning Rub

4 each Garlic cloves, peeled, mashed to a paste

3 tablespoons Olive oil

1 teaspoon Thyme, dried

1 teaspoon Basil, dried

Salt, To taste

Pepper, To taste



Preparation

Gather all the ingredients and equipment.

Trim the pork loin, tie with butcher’s twine.

Combine all ingredients for the seasoning rub (be sure to mash garlic to a smooth paste before combining with the rest of the ingredients). Rub this mixture into the pork loin.

Place the wood chips in a half, 4-inch (10-centimeter) hotel pan. Place pork loin in a half, 2-inch (5-centimeter) perforated hotel pan and place over the wood chips. Cover the pans tightly with aluminum foil.

Place pan over high heat until chips begin to smoke (about 4 to 5 minutes). Immediately remove pan from heat and set aside, under the hood system, for 45 minutes; do not remove foil (and therefore allow smoke to escape) until after the 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).

Place cold-smoked pork loin on a roasting rack in a roasting pan.

Roast the pork to an internal temperature of 135°F (57°C).

Remove from the oven and allow to rest and carry over in a warm place; temperature should reach 145°F (63°C) before serving.

The roasting pan may be deglazed to prepare a pan gravy or jus for service.

At service, slice the roast and plate, as demonstrated.
